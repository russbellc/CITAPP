    <h3>CITAPP</h3>
    <p>This application is here to make your life a whole lot easier. CITAPP Inc was founded in 
        February 2017 by a group of students from CETYS Universidad in the city of Tijuana with 
        the purpose of innovating the process of booking appointments at clinics. Since nowadays, 
        there are technological tools for nearly everything, we wanted to include the booking process 
        for something everyone does and sometimes avoids: go to the doctor.
    </p><p>
        In a busy life, like most individuals have in this era, we sometimes leave aside the 
        most important thing: US! This tool will allow you to maintain your medical records 
        at your reach and browse for specialists in the medical field that you require to have 
        access to those services.
